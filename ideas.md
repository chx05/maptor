A bunch of ideas related to the editor

- Try data structures out without launching the program, meaning I can design data more easily by instantiating stuff in the editor and visualizing it in order to spot better ways to organize data
- With the same visualization tools to try data structures directly in the editor, I also want to visualize data at runtime when debugging
- Custom data structures can attach some editor script to visualize the data structure in a custom way, so I can visualize a hand written tree with nodes and links, directly in the editor, when debugging or when trying structures out directly in the editor
